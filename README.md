# code-your-own-quiz_2 this is a project for an introduction to programming course i am taking, this is a simple quiz game. they are fill # in the blank

# it should show correct, or incorrect and give the user 3 chanced to answer correctly - the function can be no longer than 18 lines.
# for now i know i have to add a new function to display the answer, my issue is i am not sure which variables i can create/pull into the 
# next function... i have to say i didnt grasp the concept well in the class! so any help explaining how to call in the variables .. i 
# would be so grateful. this also errors out! i can provide a working program if you would like to see it,
